# On a nominally flat contact the winner is decided by micro-noise, so the load
# is winner-take-all: a vertex that wins all six of its triangles receives ~34x
# its own weight, gets pushed off, and the next iteration hands the load to a

# (side walls 91.3% + blade tip 6.6%, the edge-dense regions), while missing
# nothing (0/240000 misses).  So the defect is in the QUERY, not in the penalty
# formulation.  This backend evaluates distance and gradient against the shape's
# own triangle mesh -- the same closed mesh the bake itself queried -- so both

# more in the reaction pass.  With the flag ON the pairs that can possibly
# contact are gathered ONCE per substep into ``cand_idx`` and the 21 launches

#
# The gather test is a PROVABLE SUPERSET of that centroid cull, not a heuristic:

# within ``h + reach`` (reach = the centroid's distance to the furthest of the
# three vertices).  The blade mesh is contained in its own AABB, so

# and the pair provably early-exits.  The gather therefore keeps every pair with

# motion across the substep's 20 iterations, over which the list is held fixed.

#   gather is correct   0 pairs dropped in 6660 substeps (selfcheck kernel);
#                       candidates med 0 / max 1197 / mean 385 of 74256 pairs,

# The cost the gather removes is not the cost that matters.  A launch in which

# cloth), i.e. the far-triangle cull is ~16% of the 46.6 s the force kernel
# spends over an episode; the other ~84% is the 7 exact mesh queries the NEAR
# triangles run, which the gather keeps by construction.  And packing those
# queries into the first ~12 warps costs MORE than leaving them scattered over
# ~2300: the per-launch time is the same (0.48 / 0.51 ms) whether the launch is
# 2048 threads or 74256, so the regression is where the work sits, not how many
# threads are spawned -- the mesh-BVH traversal is latency bound and the full

# most a millimetre or two over those iterations, so the closest point and the
# surface normal can be resolved ONCE and held in the shape's local frame --
# which is what this stack already does for the rigid-feature channel (contact
# list built once per substep, normal frozen for the substep).

# T15-A: O(1) EXACT closest-point backend for the tri-SDF contact channel.
#
# The exact backend (R16_SDF_EXACT) answers every query with

# mesh.  ``tri_sdf_closest_mesh`` issues 7 of them per near triangle and they
# form a DEPENDENCY CHAIN (each refinement step needs the previous winner's
# normal), so the force kernel is latency bound: 0.369 ms/launch against
# 0.066 ms for the same kernel reading a trilinear voxel table.  T14 established
# that the query COUNT is locked by the force law (the deepest point on the
# triangle must be re-searched every Newton iteration) and that the blade cannot
# be decimated (4000 faces -> Hausdorff p99 0.26 mm, the working penetration
# depth).  So the only head left is the COST OF ONE QUERY.
#
# This backend replaces the tree walk with a table lookup that is still EXACT:
#   bake  -- on the same dense grid the SDF is baked on, store the id of the
#            NEAREST TRIANGLE at every grid point (int32), plus the mesh's
#            angle-weighted vertex pseudo-normals and edge pseudo-normals
#            (Baerentzen & Aanaes 2005, the same construction
#            ``mesh_query_point_sign_normal`` signs with).
#   query -- read the 8 corner face ids of the cell holding p, de-duplicate,
#            run the analytic point-triangle closest point (Ericson 5.1.5) on
#            each, keep the minimum, and sign it with the winning FEATURE's
#            pseudo-normal (face / edge / vertex).  Distance and normal are then
#            the same floating-point expressions the BVH path evaluates -- the
#            grid only chooses WHICH triangles to test.
#
# Not an approximation of the field, but an approximation of the CANDIDATE SET:
# the true nearest triangle of p is assumed to be the nearest triangle of one of
# the 8 corners.  That holds wherever the surface is locally resolved by the

# T16 SOFT: make the choice of contact point CONTINUOUS instead of a switch.
#
# ``_T16_SDF_ARGMIN_TOL`` removed the coin flip but replaced it with a THRESHOLD:
# under load the four candidates' depths hover right around r*h, so the winner
# still jumps 1-2 mm across the triangle, only now driven by physical noise
# crossing the threshold rather than by float noise.  Measured on the bench that
# shows up as same-arm repeat scatter going from bitwise-identical to 12%, the
# low-load delivery ratio turning NEGATIVE and the first-frame slip changing sign.
#
# SOFT replaces the hard pick of a STARTING POINT with a softmin over the four
# seeds, and then runs the SAME descent from there:
#     alpha_i  ~  exp(-(d_i - d_min) / (tau * h))          i = centroid, a, b, c
#     w_soft   =  sum_i alpha_i * w_i     (already barycentric: sum alpha = 1)
#     w        =  refine(w_soft)          the same 3 projected-gradient steps
# and the depth AND the normal are evaluated at that final point, so the force
# law and the anchor read one self-consistent point.
#
# Only the four SEEDS enter the blend, deliberately.  They average EXACTLY to the
# centroid ((wg + wa + wb + wc)/4 = (1/3,1/3,1/3)) and their depths are continuous
# in the triangle's pose, so the blend is continuous everywhere and lands on the
# centroid on a flat contact for both query backends.  Feeding the REFINED point
# into the blend instead re-injects the very arbitrary pick this is removing --
# measured: it leaves 50.941% of flat triangles disagreeing between backends,
# against 0.173% for the seeds-only blend.  The refinement is not dropped, it is
# moved: it now starts FROM w_soft, so the blade-tip regime keeps the interior
# minimum it needs (on a flat contact the projected gradient is zero and the
# descent does not move, so (1a) is unaffected).
#   flat contact  (spreads << tau*h) -> all candidates equal weight -> w_soft is
#     the centroid, and the two query backends agree bitwise;
#   tilted contact (spreads >> tau*h) -> the deepest vertex takes essentially all
#     the weight -> same answer as today;
#   in between      -> a continuous interpolation, with no threshold to cross.
# The depth this reports is at most O(tau*h) shallower than the true minimum
# (2 um at tau = 4e-3, h = 0.5 mm), i.e. ~1% of the working penetration.
# Mutually exclusive with the TOL knob: when SOFT is non-zero, TOL is forced to 0.
# 0 = OFF: every statement below is dead code.

# T16 diagnostic: where does the contact point sit, and how is the load shared?
# Pure accumulator, the force law never reads it.  Answers the question the
# tolerance experiment raised -- is the side effect coming from "the material
# point sits at the centroid, so the load is split 1/3 each" rather than from the
# threshold switch itself.  Layout of ``w_diag`` (32 floats, atomically summed
# over every pair that reaches the force law):
#   0 n | 1 centroid | 2 vertex | 3 edge/interior

# 23 edge, 24 face interior, 25 no-hit).  It is classified from an EXTRA BVH

# 0, but in float32 it is ~1e-9 m of pure rounding -- a thousand times the guard.
# The step is then ``cand = w - gw*(step/gn)``: the DIRECTION is noise but it is
# renormalised to a FULL 0.5 step, and ``dcand < best`` accepts on any
# improvement at all.  Measured: blending the seeds and then descending still
# leaves 33-40 full-width jumps in the tilt sweep and only 61-63% of flat
# triangles on the centroid, with the two backends disagreeing.
# This gate compares gn against the SAME length scale the softmin uses (tau*h),
# so a step is taken only when the barycentric gradient is real rather than
# rounding.  0 = OFF: the guard is the ``1e-12`` it always was, bit-identical.

# T17: per-SHAPE CAP on the total tangent stiffness the hardening law hands to
# the explicitly-coupled rigid side.
#
# The hardening law (``contact_hardening_inv_dmax``) multiplies BOTH the load
# and its slope: f = k*d/den, so the tangent stiffness of one contact is
#
#     dF/dd = k / den^2,   den = max(1 - d/d_max, HARDENING_DEN_MIN)
#
# i.e. up to 1/0.05^2 = 400x the linear k at the incompressible core.  The cloth
# solver is implicit and does not care, but the finger is coupled EXPLICITLY:
# the reaction wrench is evaluated once per substep and held constant inside the
# 2 ms MuJoCo step, so the finger sees a spring integrated with forward Euler and
# the stability condition is the explicit one, K*dt^2/m < 4.  With m = 0.025 kg
# (the MJCF link mass) and dt = 2 ms that is K < 25 kN/m, while T10-C measured
# the wall region at ~6.4 MN/m -- 250x over -- and the finger force blew up to
# 85-550 N against a 6 N effort limit (doc GRIPPER-CONTACT.md T10-C).
#
# The cap keeps the law but bounds what it can add:
#
#     Sigma(shape) = sum_i k_i / den_i^2                  (uncapped, measured)
#     s            = min(1, k_max(shape) / Sigma_prev)    (one substep of lag)
#     1/den_eff    = 1 + (1/den - 1) * s
#
# so the LINEAR part (1/den = 1) is never scaled -- s only shrinks the EXCESS the
# hardening adds -- and s = 1 reproduces the stock hardening bit for bit.
# ``k_max`` is set per shape from the host as c * m_body / dt^2 (see
# ``set_shape_hardening_kcap``); c = 1 is a quarter of the explicit limit.
#
# 1 = cap the TOTAL tangent sum (the literal budget: everything the shape's
#     contacts hand the rigid side must fit under k_max).
# 2 = cap the hardening EXCESS only, Sigma_x = sum_i (k_i/den_i^2 - k_i).  Use
#     when the LINEAR sum alone already exceeds k_max (many contacts): mode 1
#     then drives s to ~0 and switches the law off, while mode 2 still budgets
#     the extra stiffness against the same explicit limit.
# 0 = OFF: not one statement below runs and the hardening law is the R13c one,
#     bit-identical.

    ``p(eps) = k0*eps/(1 - eps/eps_max)`` (doc GRIPPER-CONTACT 2.2) is a
    TRANSVERSE COMPRESSION law for the fabric, so its reference length is the
    cloth's own thickness ``t0``, not the penalty band:

        eps = delta / t0,   d_max = eps_max * t0,   eps_max in (0, 1)

    R13 (2026-08-28) corrects R9 here.  R9 used the band as the compressible
    layer, on the stated premise that "the geometric stop sits at the cloth's
    physical half-thickness and everything between it and the band is the
    padding the force law is allowed to squeeze".  R12 measured that premise
    false: with a 6 mm band the closest cloth particle during a HOLD sits
    2.02 mm from the blade and every one of the 112 loaded contacts lies
    3.75-6.00 mm out, i.e. the gripper never reaches the cloth at all and the
    real compression is zero.  Referencing the strain to the band therefore
    put the operating point at 39% of d_max (hardening factor 1.65, law
    effectively dormant) while a 5.26 mm "graze" contact sat PAST d_max and
    took the 20x cap.  Both are artefacts of the wrong reference length.

    ``t0`` comes from the cloth itself (2 x particle_radius; the asset meta
    carries ``thickness: 1e-3`` for blue_tshirt_9k), so the law is mesh- and
    band-independent and the asymptote lands where de Jong's incompressible
    core does: single-layer compression <= 0.32*t0, two layers in the jaw
    <= 0.6 mm (archive cloth-pinch-contact-research.md).

    PER SHAPE, not global: the table is a half-space the cloth is meant to lie
    on, and an asymptote there would turn resting on the table into a wall.
    The default array is all zeros, so every shape returns 0.0 and the force
    law takes its stock linear branch -- bit-identical default path.  The value
    is a per-shape scalar, so the branch is uniform across the warp and there
    is no host-side decision (CUDA graph safe).

    The stock particle-rigid law (``_compute_body_particle_contact_force``)
    feeds this substep's relative displacement into an IPC-mollified friction
    term, i.e. pure viscosity with the history cleared every substep — a pinched
    bite therefore ratchets out of the jaw at a steady creep rate. Here the
    tangential force is instead a spring toward an anchor stored in the SHAPE's
    frame (so it rides along with the finger), clamped to the Coulomb cone by
    elastoplastic return mapping: inside the cone the contact truly sticks, and
    once the cone is exceeded the anchor is dragged so the offset lands exactly

########################################################################################################################
# R2-3.  Volino's Intersection Contour Minimisation with the "face" side taken
# from a RIGID mesh instead of the cloth.  ``solve_untangling_kernel`` above is
# the stock cloth-cloth version; what it implements -- once the cloth is ALREADY
# through, shrink the intersection contour until it is gone -- has no
# counterpart for cloth-vs-gripper.  The penalty and projection channels only
# know how to push a particle towards the NEAREST surface, which for a blade
# thinner than the penetration depth is the wrong side half of the time, and
# neither of them sees a particle that sits outside the shell while its EDGE
# threads straight through the plate.
#
# Signed distance cannot express "which way is out" for a thin plate; the
# intersection CONTOUR can, because its length is zero exactly when the cloth is
# untangled.  The gradient of that length w.r.t. the crossing edge is Volino's
# ``intersection_gradient_vector`` (already used above), so this kernel is the
# same law with ``rigid_pos``/``rigid_tri_indices`` on the face side.
#
# Default OFF.  Nothing is allocated and no kernel is launched unless
# ``Collision.enable_rigid_untangling`` has been called, so the default path
# never reaches this code.
#
# Asymmetric by construction: the reaction on the rigid body is NOT accumulated.
# ICM is a topological recovery force, not a contact force -- the normal load and
# its reaction stay with the penalty channel (2.4).  Feeding a recovery impulse
# back into MuJoCo would show up as a fake grip force.

    With ``friction_scale > 0`` the same pass also resolves Coulomb friction at
    the position level (XPBD style): the tangential slip accumulated over this
    substep, measured RELATIVE to the shape's own motion, is cancelled outright
    while it stays inside the cone, and clamped back onto the cone once it
    leaves. This is the half our original projection was missing -- PBD engines
    solve normal non-penetration and friction in the SAME iteration loop, and
    friction is the part that actually consumes the iterations.

    Cone half-width is ``mu * |normal correction applied this pass|``, the XPBD
    form. It has to be the correction and not the standing overlap: the
    correction is what a squeeze produces each pass and what a contact at rest
    stops producing, so friction fades on its own when the jaw opens. Riding the
    cone on the standing overlap instead glues the cloth to the finger forever
    whenever ``slack > 0``, since slack guarantees the overlap never reaches
    zero (measured: cloth still hanging 3-14 mm off the open jaw, 198/198
    frames penetrating). The corollary is that static friction and slack are
    incompatible -- run this branch with ``slack = 0`` and take the reaction
    force from the pre-projection state instead.

    """COMPLIANT triangle-level contact: a penalty force into the implicit solve.

    The position-projection form of this constraint fights the penalty channel:
    the projection removes exactly the overlap the penalty needs to produce a
    force, so the reaction collapses when the collision radius is retired
    (measured: 8.5 N at r=4 mm -> 0.8 N at r=0.5 mm, and raising ke does not
    bring it back). Here the SAME constraint carries the force:

        F = k_tri * (h - min_{x in tri} SDF)      along the SDF gradient
        k_tri = E_t * A_tri / t0                  (material, not a constant)

    so geometry and reaction come from one mechanism and nothing competes for the
    overlap. The compression that produces the force is the cloth's own
    transverse compliance, not an inflated collision radius; sum_tri A_tri is the
    cloth's area whatever the tessellation, so the load is mesh independent.
